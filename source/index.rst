KQMH Background
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Kenya Quality Model for Health is defined as a conceptual framework for guiding and supporting coordination in an integrated manner, efforts and investments aimed at improving quality of healthcare in Kenya. This part of the project will by providing 47 health facilities with IT-based tools to support continuous quality improvement in line with the KQMH standard.
The goal of this model is; 

1. Improve adherence to standards and guidelines through evidence-informed medicine. 
2. Apply quality principles and tools and satisfying patient/client needs in a culturally appropriate way. 
3. Guide integration of patient partnership in the healthcare process.

A practically usable checklist is part of the model and is intended for use at all levels of health facilities, in line with the services provided. It should be used for facility self-assessment, peer assessment of network of facilities and by external assessors like regulator or certification bodies. All facilities shall carry out self-assessment. The role of the assessor will be to validate the assessment results.
The KQMH User Manual gives a step to step guide on how to navigate through, logging in, data entry, report generation and logging out.
